# Timetable Scheduling Algorithm Documentation

## 1. Algorithm Overview

The Automatic Timetable Scheduling system uses a **backtracking algorithm with graph coloring principles** to generate conflict-free academic schedules. This document explains how the algorithm works, its implementation details, and optimization techniques used.

## 2. Problem Formulation

### 2.1 Graph Coloring Representation

The timetable scheduling problem can be modeled as a graph coloring problem:

- **Vertices**: Courses and their respective sessions
- **Edges**: Constraints between courses (e.g., same faculty, same room requirement)
- **Colors**: Time slots

The goal is to assign a color (time slot) to each vertex (course session) such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, meaning no two courses with constraints between them can be scheduled at the same time.

### 2.2 Constraint Types

The algorithm handles several types of constraints:

1. **Hard Constraints** (must be satisfied):
   - A faculty member cannot teach two courses simultaneously
   - A room cannot host two courses simultaneously
   - A course must be scheduled in one of the faculty's available time slots

2. **Soft Constraints** (preferably satisfied):
   - Multiple sessions of the same course should be distributed across different days
   - Faculty workload should be balanced across the week

## 3. Backtracking Algorithm

### 3.1 Core Principles

Backtracking is a depth-first search technique that:

1. **Incrementally builds** a solution by making choices one at a time
2. **Abandons a path** as soon as it determines the path cannot lead to a valid solution
3. **Backtracks** to the most recent choice point and tries an alternative

### 3.2 Algorithm Steps

The algorithm follows these steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Clear any existing schedules
   - Sort courses by constraint level (courses with higher weekly sessions first)
   - Expand courses into individual sessions
   - Initialize data structures for tracking assignments

2. **Recursive Scheduling Function** (for each course):
   - Get available time slots based on faculty availability
   - Sort time slots to prioritize days with fewer faculty assignments
   - For each available time slot:
     - Check if faculty is already scheduled at this time
     - For each available room:
       - Check if room is already booked at this time
       - If both are free, assign the course to this (room, time slot)
       - Recursively try to schedule the next course
       - If successful, return the solution
       - Otherwise, remove this assignment (backtrack) and try another option

3. **Termination**:
   - If all courses are scheduled, return the complete timetable
   - If no valid schedule is possible, return failure

### 3.3 Pseudocode
```
course, session = courses_to_schedule[index]
faculty = course.faculty

available_time_slots = GetAvailableTimeSlots(faculty)
course_days = GetDaysAlreadyScheduledForCourse(course)

for time_slot in available_time_slots:
    # Skip if trying to schedule multiple sessions on same day
    if session > 1 and time_slot.day in course_days:
        continue
        
    # Skip if faculty already scheduled at this time
    if FacultyAlreadyScheduled(faculty, time_slot):
        continue
        
    for room in available_rooms:
        # Skip if room already booked
        if RoomAlreadyBooked(room, time_slot):
            continue
            
        # Try this assignment
        schedule = CreateScheduleEntry(course, room, time_slot)
        faculty_day_assignments[faculty.id][time_slot.day] += 1
        
        # Recursively schedule next course
        if ScheduleCourses(courses_to_schedule, faculty_day_assignments, index+1):
            return SUCCESS
            
        # Backtrack
        RemoveScheduleEntry(schedule)
        faculty_day_assignments[faculty.id][time_slot.day] -= 1

return FAILURE  # No valid schedule found for this course
```

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1 Class Structure

The algorithm is implemented through two main classes:

1. **TimetableScheduler**: Core scheduler that generates complete timetables
2. **AnimatedTimetableScheduler**: Extended version that tracks algorithm steps for visualization

### 4.2 Optimization Techniques

Several optimization techniques are employed to improve performance:

1. **Variable Ordering Heuristics**:
   - Courses with more sessions are scheduled first
   - This follows the "most constrained variable first" principle

2. **Value Ordering Heuristics**:
   - Time slots are prioritized based on faculty workload distribution
   - Days with fewer assignments for a faculty are preferred
   - Random shuffling is used to avoid predictable patterns

3. **Constraint Tracking**:
   - In-memory tracking of assignments to reduce database queries
   - Course day assignments are tracked to distribute sessions

4. **Early Constraint Checking**:
   - Course sessions are checked for day distribution early
   - Faculty and room availability are checked before attempting assignments

### 4.3 Database Integration

The algorithm interacts with the Django database models:

- Queries faculty availability constraints
- Creates tentative schedule entries during exploration
- Removes entries during backtracking
- Finalizes the schedule when a complete solution is found

## 5. Algorithm Visualization

To aid understanding, the system includes a visualization component:

1. **Step Tracking**: Each algorithm step is recorded with relevant data
2. **Step Types**:
   - `init`: Algorithm initialization
   - `course`: Starting to schedule a course
   - `attempt`: Trying a specific (course, room, time_slot) assignment
   - `conflict`: Detecting a constraint violation
   - `backtrack`: Undoing an assignment
   - `success`: Successfully assigning a course

3. **Visual Representation**:
   - Courses are represented as nodes in a graph
   - Constraints are shown as edges between nodes
   - Colors represent time slot assignments
   - Animation shows the algorithm's progress

## 6. Key Algorithm Challenges and Solutions

### 6.1 Constraint Satisfaction

**Challenge**: Ensuring all hard constraints are satisfied.

**Solution**: Systematic checking before each assignment and backtracking when violations are detected.

### 6.2 Combinatorial Explosion

**Challenge**: The search space grows exponentially with the number of courses and constraints.

**Solution**:
- Intelligent variable ordering (most constrained first)
- Value ordering heuristics (least constraining value first)
- Early constraint checking

### 6.3 Performance Optimization

**Challenge**: Generating schedules quickly for realistic problem sizes.

**Solution**:
- In-memory tracking to reduce database queries
- Prioritizing promising assignments first
- Tracking day assignments to distribute course sessions efficiently

## 7. Performance Characteristics

### 7.1 Time Complexity

The worst-case time complexity of the backtracking algorithm is O(m^n), where:
- n is the number of course sessions to be scheduled
- m is the number of possible (room, time_slot) combinations

However, with heuristics and early constraint checking, the practical performance is much better than this theoretical worst case.

### 7.2 Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of course sessions, as we need to store:
- The current partial assignment
- Tracking data structures for constraints
- The recursion stack

### 7.3 Practical Performance

For typical academic scheduling scenarios (50-100 courses):
- Execution time: Seconds to minutes
- Success rate: > 95% for reasonably constrained problems
- Failure cases: Only when constraints are too tight to allow any valid solution

## 8. Example Execution Trace

Here's a simplified trace of the algorithm's execution:

1. Start with course CS101 (Session 1/3)
   - Try Monday 9:00 in Room 101 → Success
   - Move to next course

2. Schedule CS101 (Session 2/3)
   - Try Tuesday 9:00 in Room 101 → Success
   - Move to next course

3. Schedule CS101 (Session 3/3)
   - Try Wednesday 9:00 in Room 101 → Success
   - Move to next course

4. Schedule MATH101 (Session 1/3)
   - Try Monday 9:00 in Room 102 → Success (different room than CS101)
   - Move to next course

5. Schedule MATH101 (Session 2/3)
   - Try Tuesday 9:00 in Room 102 → Success
   - Move to next course

6. Continue until all courses are scheduled or a conflict can't be resolved

This approach ensures that all constraints are satisfied, and when conflicts arise, the algorithm backtracks and tries alternative assignments until a complete solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.
